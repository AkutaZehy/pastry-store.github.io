            <h4> 1.Reversed world, a little euphoria in the Post-Apocalyptic World<br /></h4>
            <p><em>*Post-Apocalyptic is also henceforth referred to as P-A.</em></p>
            <p class="intb"> Frankly speaking, you have to watch <em>Girls' Last Tour</em>, <b>thoroughly</b>.<br />
                You see, many say that it's a quite depressive work and has an awfully heartbreaking ending. But that's perhaps <b>interpret out of context</b> since quite a few haven't read the whole story.<br />
                The girls are living in a post-apocalyptic world, after a war almost/actually wiped out the human race. So it's
                normal, exactly speaking, is <b>environmental normal</b>.<br />
                ——Coolink_95 </p>
            <p> As mentioned, it's essential to base the understanding of the whole work in a P-A world, or misunderstanding occurs from time to time.<br />
                What does the work want to convey? Take your minutes to carefully think about that.<br />
                When you are ready, roll your eyesight down to receive <em>a possible explanation</em>. </p>
            <h5>i.</h5>
            <p>Let's describe the work first.<br />
                Desperation? No from one aspect. On the contrary maybe <em>a little euphoria</em>.<br />
                By the way, do you remember, when Kanazawa lost his maps, he cried out bluely, but when seperated, he smiled, staying opmistic and went on. When Ishii's aircraft crashed, she fell with a complex smile, consisting of hopelessness and frustration. We know their sad ending. <b>Every <em>nothing</em> fought for their fate.</b> </p>
            <p class="intb"><b>絶望と、仲良く。</b></p>
            <p>That's words of Yuuri, also the spirit of the work.<br /></p>
            <h5>ii.</h5>
            <p>In my opinion, the work reflects on our life, our growing up.<br />
                At the beginning Chito could't abandon his diary, Yuuri couldn't lose her gun. But when they climbed up,they gradually abandoned everything:when the Kettenkrad could no longer use, they took a nice bath, and went on by walking; Yuuri <em>threw</em> her gun away to make the journey easier; Chito burned her diary for warmth. And
                finally they reached the end, and finally had <em>a long sleep</em>.<br />
                So do us. We should learn to have somthing when we're young, but when we grow up, we gradually realize what is important while what is not. Having seperated from what we love, so that we can forth with less burden.<br />
                Also, the older we are, the less needs do we have. According to <em>Maslow's hierarchy of needs</em>, our needs are dived into 5 levels:Physiological needs, Safety needs, Love and belonging, Esteem and Self-actualization(Self-Transcendence needs). Roughly speaking, this work in P-A world actually shows a retrogression of needs. The girls cared more about their physiological needs than spiritual ones as the story advance. Somehow that's because they <em>do</em> had more physiological needs, but in other aspects, it shows a unique understanding of life: </p>
            <p class="intb"><b>When satisfied with everything, so we can face death without hesitation and regret</b>.<br /></p>
            <h5>iii.</h5>
            <p>As for Kanazawa and Ishii, maybe they just serve as a foil to main figures, showing other attitudes towards life.<br />
                In this work, we see many desperate moments, and we also should get along with those. To face the rough life with a flattened attitude, to enjoy the pure way of what ancient people do may be one explaionation of this work. 
            </p>
            <p>Generally speaking, I would conclude this opinion like this:</p>
            <p class="intb">When <em>Bible</em> told us,<br />
                For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have more: but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.<br />
                I would like to say,<br />
                <b>Be appreciated for what you have more, be peaceful for what you don't.<br />
                Get along well with desperation.</b> </p>
        </div>
        
        
        <div>
            <h4> 2.Mirror of real life, what ARE we doing? </h4>
            <p>Reflect on the work again for a few minutes, thinking about the relationship among ALL figures.<br />
                When you are ready,roll your eyes down to see what happens next. 
            </p>
            <p>Let's go.<br /></p>
            <h5>i.</h5>
            <p>The story happened as a post war scene, so most of the unreal scenes can be easily explained, such as: </p>
            <p class="intb">[Food]Divided in half, so a month; for myself, a week.<br /></p>
            <p>But have you ever thought that all of these <em>have happened, are happening, and will be happening</em>?<br />
                For example, when the deadly Plague(also Black Death) attacked Europe, we've lost millions of people.<b>People have been facing disaster from time to time.</b><br />
                For example, when we are arguing with our best friends, that's <em>the smallest war</em>, as Chito and Yuuri often did.<br />
                For example, When insanes gather, then maybe the humans' fortune could end. That probably be <em>the Future</em>, as it is joking said, </p>
            <p class="intb">Never doubt that any person could exist since there's many.</p>
            <p><em>And <b>numberous</b> examples. </em>It's sad to know this fact.</p>
            <h5>ii.</h5>
            <p>But why not be delighted? Good things are happening in the meantime.</p>
            <p class="intb">Lock was only designed for <em>Normals</em>. Saints never thought about stealing, while Evils never forgot.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, I need to refer to another interviewee.</p>
            <p class="intb">... But what Girls' Last Tour strongly transmits is the teamwork, because everyone has different skills which are needed in order to survive.<br />
                ——Modem／くるみん　さん</p>
            <p>As mentioned,every nothing fought for their fate. <em><b>So do nothings</b></em>.<br />
                And that's we are doing,<br />
                <b>On your post</b>. </p>
            <p>Generally speaking, I would conclude this opinion like this:</p>
            <p class="intb"><b>Watching them, <em>watching</em> yourself.</b></p>
        </div>
        
        
        <div>
            <h4> 3.Lifelong tourist, life destination and moral questions </h4>
            <p>Take a look at yourself.<br />
                Gradually you find yourself in a really embarrassing condition.<br />
                For different person, the period lasts for different length. </p>
            <p>When Human fought for living, the manager stayed slient and left the right to decide the fish's life to Human, while the artificial intelligence managing the sixth tower prayed and for death. <br />
                SARCASTIC.<br />
                It reminds me of <em>KAPPA(河童)</em> and its author, Akutagawa Ryunosuke(芥川龍之介)<br />
                Read him, and his encounter is what I want to tell you. </p>
            <h5><b>Morever</b>. </h5>
            <p>Well, I have to say, this used to be the part I've forgotten for such a long time and caused me had a really narrow understanding of this work.<br />
                A little challenging this part, be patient and read the content below.<br />
                It's about <b>humanity, nature and cycle</b>.<br />
                <br />
                To be honest, I haven't read many books about philosophy such as <em>Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung</em> (by Arthur Schopenhauer,1819), so my point of view is actually one-sided. However, the process of sharing is quite enjoyful.<br />
                Let's start with a simple question:<br />
                How will you define <em>HUMAN</em> or <em>HUMANITY</em>, in order to set them apart from other creatures? </p>
            <p>The answer from me, is</p>
            <p class="intb">WHAT'S DIFFERENT.</p>
            <p>Well it may seem a bit obscure, then let me explain it to you.<br />
                Have an example first, just use Girl's Last Tour.<br />
                Chito, Yuuri, Kanazawa, Ishii and gramdpa, woman in the photo, people recorded, are <i>traditional</i> HUMANs, while autonomous machines, artificial intelligence managing the sixth tower, Nuko and Eryngiis are just <i>HUMANOID</i>.<br />
                And what's different?<br />
                My answer is:</p>
            <p class="intb">MERCY.</p>
            <p>You may be surprised at it, but maybe that's right:which is determined by OUR <i>sociality</i> and <i>ideology</i>.<br />
                Maybe your answer is life? Animals and plants are all alive.<br />
                Maybe your answer is language? Eryngiis had developed their language, superior to Chito and Yuuri's.<br />
                Maybe your answer is dedication? It's just social behaviour, community animals know this.<br />
                Maybe your answer is spirit? In my opinion, when the AI committed her suicide, she had finished her task to reach her spirit.<br />
            </p>
            <p>Why <i>Mercy</i> ?</p>
            <p class="intb">We all understand the pain of creatures well when we are mature,<br />
                While repeating doing wrong things again and again.<br />
                When we finally decided to do something,<br />
                Then comes what we call <i>Mercy</i>. </p>
            <p>We learn edifying after we learn to "Mercy".<br />
                Sometimes we surprisingly find that an animal learn to be something like so called "Human",  however, they never learn to "Mercy", or at least we never lowered ourselves to call it "Mercy" </p>
            <p> Without mercy, we stood, we fought, we invaded, we expanded our home from caves, to lands, to seas, to inside the earth, to beyond the sky, maybe further, unlimited?<br />
                With mercy, we started communicating, taming, saving lives from "man-made thunders", fighting with pens and ink.<br />
                Then we see the cycle, the nature, the thing we used to call them 'infinite'. </p>
            <p>Take a minute for what you have just learnt.</p>
        </div>
        
        
        <div>
            <h4> 4.Literary significance, universality and peculiarity </h4>
            <p>This work is connected to many famous works, but the ones I want to mention the most,are <i>Waiting for Godot</i> and <i>Truman Show</i>, based on which I made several changes in my video to make my point of view clear and obvious.</p>
            <h5>i. Waiting for Godot, what are you waiting for?</h5>
            <p>I strongly suggest you to read/watch the whole drama first, having <em>enough</em> understanding of it, or the content below will be hard for you to understand.</p>
            <p>Ready? Let's answer a question first.<br />
                Who is Godot in the play? </p>
            <p>When you find the answer for the question, you are close to my opinion.<br />
                My answer is: </p>
            <p class="intb">There's no Godot, but he <em>is</em> to be waited.</p>
            <p>Strange huh? Let's turn to another dimension.<br />
                If I ask, were the Girls getting upward, or downward? Were they getting further from home, or getting closer?<br />
                Think twice before you <b>make sure</b>, then you would get the point interesting here.<br />
                Think about the keys from their grandpa.<br />
                <em>A contradictory but reasonable conclusion: they were departing from their home, but setting out for their home, right?</em> </p>
            <p>Waiting for Godot, or to be accurate in the story, going upward, is meaningless in a sense.<br />
                So do our daily lives. Give it a shot to seek for the origin to do one daily task, gradually more and more until everything you do everyday. You'll find it true. </p>
            <p>You may get more and more confused when your understanding of this opinion getting deeper and deeper.<br />
                You may think, when life is a certain, why should myself struggling to make a life? Everything I do is in vain, why should I live?<br />
                You may be trapped in those strange thoughts, or you may never think about it. That doesn't matter. <br />
            </p>
            <p>One of my best friends gave me a good answer to explain this:</p>
            <p class='intb'> So if it's meaningless to live, so is death.<br />
                They are just a sign, a boolean flag, meaningless.<br />
                However, why do I choose to live? I'm just too used to this kind of life so I would trigger the <em>SWITCH</em> to change. </p>
            <p>Go and figure out your own anwer, always remember:</p>
            <p class="intb">We are waiting for Godot, but he said he is to come <em>tomorrow.</em></p>
            
            <h5>ii. Truman Show, his show, our show</h5>
            <p><em>*This part is not quite associated with the original manga.</em></p>
            <p>Was Chito experiencing the story, or writing the story?<br />
                Maybe, you cried a lot when finished reading the manga. But if I tell you it's <em>being designed</em>, just assume that, Ishii is having a nice cup of bear and declaring her success of writting the story of Girls' Last Tour, while Chito and Yuuri are doing college experienments or reading books in the coffee shop called "Heaven" (According to <em>Shimeji Simulation</em>), will you get relieved?<br />
                And probably, you will get more stressful if I tell you that your life is the same. </p>
            <p>To be honest, this is a bit of a conspiracy theory, but it is undeniable that I am really intoxicated by such an interesting point of view.<br />
                I wonder if you have discovered the world's <em>LOOPHOLE</em>. Go and have a try. </p>
            <br />

    <h2>Part 2:Experience about the work,帰郷(ききょう)</h2>
        <div>
            <h4>1.Storyboard & Timeline Design</h4>
            <p>To write the storyboard well, I read the manga and scanned anime for enough times.<br />
                The core is to contain and mix everything together in one video.<br />
                Of course,to come up with an idea is awesome, but find a method to express it is quite demanding.<br />
                To ensure the content is right, I read a lot of related remarks about this manga, many surprisingly findings after reading two <i>long</i> remarks, both around 5,000 words in total.<br />
                And now, what you have seen above was what I concluded, together with my own experience. </p>
            <p> Also, there's something interesting that just sometime I came up with, and I thought it would be inspiring for you to see those thoughts and dive deeply to discover <i>The Real Meaning</i> as your <i>Hamlet</i>. </p>
            <h4>2.Audio</h4>
            <p>To be honest it's really a miserable and also joyful process.</p>
            <h5>i.First Part, the base audio</h5>
            <p>This part finished quite early,20/02/XX or so.<br />
                Since there are good deeds and original song, earcopying is no more difficult.</p>
            <h5>ii.Second Part, detail process & Volume Mastering I</h5>
            <p>Well,this part is a bit difficult than the last one since I did too many things wrong such as using the wrong plug-in.<br />
                Luckily, things didn't get that worse, so finished around 20/08/26.</p>
            <h5>ii.Third Part, Volume Mastering II</h5>
            <p>Miserable.<br />
              I did a lot changes to make the audio sounds better, and always looking for help.<br />
              Around 2021 Jan. I achieved a lot after learning the skills of EQ Mastering.<br />
              With a few tips from my friends, this part was finished in 21/02/07.
